# CryptChat
<h3>A secure messaging Android application - Context</h3>
<ul>
<li>We’re living in an era of communication and we feel a constant need to share texts, photos, videos or recordings with our family and friends using our mobile devices, but in this extended exchange of information it is really important to know that we are using secured communication channels. Server-side encryption is getting popular, as people are more worried about the security of their data and about their privacy and it’s not hard to believe that data leakage can happen even inside world-wide companies like <a href="https://www.comparitech.com/blog/information-security/microsoft-customer-service-data-leak/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/03/technology/twitter-password-bug/index.html">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.comparitech.com/blog/information-security/267-million-phone-numbers-exposed-online/">Facebook</a>, because of poor security or cyberattacks. Companies that own mobile messaging applications can be vulnerable to cyberattacks, competitors that want to steal users’ data or there are simply some security breaches or malfunctions inside the companies’ servers. The efficient solution that experts in cybersecurity recommend is the need to implement end-to-end encryption, reducing the risk for these type of cyberattacks and adding an extra layer of security against data leakage, such as: email addresses, passwords, mobile numbers, residential address, bank accounts, etc.

<li>
One of the objectives of CryptChat is to approach this issue, using more methods: implementing end-to-end encryption, encrypting and hashing personal data to ensure users’ privacy and authentification - users must verify and identify themselves using an unique code.
</li>
  
<li> 
By using this type of application, users can communicate through a secure channel, which ensures data confidentiality. This advantage can be integrated into complex applications dedicated to the business environment, companies can apply these methods to protect customer data and secure communication between employees.
